## About Me

I graduated Case Western Reserve University with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Cognitive Science and, upon graduation, I worked at a neuropsychiatry lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. The lab primarily investigated short-term memory in first-episode schizophrenia patients using functional MRI scans. From this experience, I learned how integral computer science has become in neuroscience research, and I wanted to gain a better theoretical knowledge of that disipline. To help me achieve this goal, I enrolled at Northeastern University's ALIGN Master of Science in Computer Science, where I hope to gain the skills and knowledge to advance my career in research.

## About My Project

Developing a deep learning model that is able to predict age from a T1 structural MRI scan. The age range will be between 0 - 18 with scans provided by the Human Connectome Project.
