## About Me

I graduated Case Western Reserve University with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology 
and Cognitive Science and, upon graduation, I worked at a neuropsychiatry lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
The lab primarily investigated short-term memory in first-episode schizophrenia patients using functional MRI scans.
From this experience, I learned how integral computer science has become in neuroscience research, 
and I wanted to gain a better theoretical knowledge of that disipline. To help me achieve this goal, 
I enrolled at Northeastern University's ALIGN Master of Science in Computer Science, where I hope to 
gain the skills and knowledge to advance my career in research.

## About My Advisor
 
Dr. Jeongkyu Lee is a teaching professor at Northeastern University. His research interests include big data, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, database systems, data visualization, and deep learning. More information can be found at his Northeastern webpage, located [here](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/jeongkyu-lee/).

## About My Project

The aim of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network that is able to identify a child or adolescent's 
                        age based on their structural MRI brain scan. Being able to create models that identify age based on an image of a person's brain 
                        could eventually be used to predict psychiatric or neurological diseases. Data is provided by the Human Connectome Project, and the age ranges of this
                        model will be between 5 and 21 years of age.
