Completed the binary classification model. It performed moderately well on the validation set, indicating that there are distinquishing characteristics between different brains. That being said, 
it seems unlikely that a classification model would be successful. I plan on creating a regression model instead. 

The results for the binary classification model are below. The model was trained with an 70/15/15 split, with 75% being used for the training data, 15% being used for the validation data, and another 15% being used for the testing data. The architecture of the model consisted of five blocks, each containing a 3 x 3 x 3 kernal size 3D convolutional block [filter size 32-64-128-256-64] with ReLU activation, a batch normalization layer, and a 2 x 2 x 2 pool size max pooling layer. The sixth block consisted of a global average pooling layer, a dense layer, dropout layer with 30% dropout, and another dense layer with sigmoid activation. The learning rate was 0.001, the loss metric was binary cross entropy loss, and the following were used as metrics to evaluate the model: accuracy, precision, false positive rate, false negative rate, true positive rate, true negative rate, AUC, and recall. The model was trained on ten epochs.
