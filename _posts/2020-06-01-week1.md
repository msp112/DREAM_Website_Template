This week, I designed my research project. To come up with the idea, I went through neuroscience literature that used machine learning models on MRI images to predict certain outcomes. Throughout my search, I was surprised that most articles researched healthy adults instead of healthy children. This gave me an idea of a target demographic that may be interesting to investigate. 

Abnormal development in childhood is thought to be linked to certain psychopathology and neurodevelopmental disorders. As such, creating models to map the trajectory of development starting young may be helpful in identifying certain diseases. One metric used to mark this development is called "brain age," or what the typical brain should look like given a child's age. Studies used T1 and T2 MRI scans to create deep learning models that were able to accurately predict the age of the child. 

I wanted to explore this concept more. I created a rough draft of this idea and presented it to my research advisor. The next steps would be to get access to the dataset, which may take a couple of weeks. In the meantime, I can start identifying features I want to incorporate into my model to investigate brain age, and I can design an MRI protocol for processing the DICOM files. 

Additionally, I also created this website from the DREAM template to keep track of my progress this summer.
