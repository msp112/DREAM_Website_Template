The dataset finally gained approval, and I should have all the data for my project. I used the 
                        remainder of this week to put all the important components together on my website and to fimilarize
                        myself with the dataset. I will edit the 
                        style of the website throughout the semester, 
                        but I will begin to focus primarily on my project. <br><br>
                        
                        Next week, I will begin looking over the data to figure out pre-processing and features for my model.
                        If pre-processing steps need to be completed, I will develop the script and start the process on 
                        Discovery or the Northeastern servers.
