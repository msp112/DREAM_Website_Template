**September 17 - 23, 2023**

This week I began drafting my model by analyzing research papers on features other researchers focused on. I also have been reading deep learning 
theory to better understand how the model needs to be developed. I have also been drafting appropriate statistical models to help test the model. This is important, because
if the model with the board age range is ineffective, further developments fine-tuning the model will be error-prone.

Currently I have been experiencing some errors with the data, which I will need to consult with the Human Connectome Project to help me troubleshoot. Unfortunately, this will
need to wait until after I get back from the Grace Hopper Conference.
