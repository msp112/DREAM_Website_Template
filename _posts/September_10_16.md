I met with my advisor to come up with a concrete plan on how to start the project. Beforehand, I looked through the demographics
data to figure out the range of ages throughout development. Based on the distribution of ages, I will need to adjust my age range since the ages on
the extreme ends are sparser than the ages in the middle of the distribution. I also tried to download the data, but I unfortunately could not. I 
will submit a ticket to help troubleshooting this error

Since the images are already preprocessed, my immediate goal would be to train the model using 
a broad age range. For example, instead of specifically identifying an age, my model should predict a range of ages the brain should belong to. Eventually, 
I will continue to fine-tune the model to identify specific ages.
