Created a regression CNN model based on neuroimages and children's age. I also created a classification model to compare to. The classification model performed significantly worse and would not

Results from the regression model will be included in the final paper, and my paper will primarily talk about this model since it was the most successful. For transparency, the results from the classification model are presented below.
