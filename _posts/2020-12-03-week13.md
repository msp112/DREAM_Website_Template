Created a regression CNN model based on neuroimages and children's age. I also created a classification model to compare to. The classification model performed significantly worse and would not 
work as a reliable predictor of age. That being said, the regression model performs reasonably well. Results from the regression model will be included in the final paper, and my paper will primarily talk about this model since it was the most successful. For transparency, the results from the classification model are presented below. 

The architecture included five blocks, each having a 3 x 3 x 3 three dimensional convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer, and a 2 x 2 x 2 max pooling layer. The filter size for the convolutional layer changed from 32-64-128-256-64. The last block consists of a global average pooling layer, a dropout layer with a 30% dropout rate, and a dense layer with a softmax activation. This was a classification model, and accuracy was measured by whether the correct age was predicted. The only measures for the multi-class classification system were categorical cross entropy loss and accuracy. 

As shown below, the multiclassification system performed very poorly. Because of the preliminary results below, I decided to abandon the idea
